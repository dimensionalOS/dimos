"""unitree_go2_pgo: run the jnav PGO live on the Go2's onboard lidar (no Mid-360
mount) and visualize the optimized pose graph in Rerun.

GO2Connection streams the onboard lidar already accumulated in the odom/world
frame plus the robot pose as a PoseStamped. The PGO instead wants a raw
sensor-frame scan plus a nav_msgs Odometry, so NormalizeGo2Lidar sits in
between: it takes the onboard `lidar`, subtracts the pose from every point
(world -> base_link) and re-emits the scan as `cloud` alongside an `odometry`.
The PGO consumes both and emits a loop-closed `pose_graph` (Graph3D), which the
Rerun bridge renders as nodes (keyframes) + edges (odom backbone in green, loop
closures in yellow).

For the Mid-360 + Point-LIO rig instead, see `unitree_go2_mid360_pgo`.

Run on the dog:
    dimos run unitree-go2-pgo
