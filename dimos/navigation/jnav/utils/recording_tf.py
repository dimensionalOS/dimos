class RecordingTF(StreamTF):
    """``StreamTF`` that caches the whole recording's tf in one pass.

    ``StreamTF`` is built for live/windowed use: each lookup keeps only a window
    around the query time and evicts everything else. Recordings often publish
    near-static frames (sensor mounts, ``world->map``) exactly once at the start
    of the ``tf`` stream rather than into ``tf_static``, so a windowed lookup at
    any later time drops those edges and the transform chain breaks. Loading the
    full stream once keeps them buffered for the entire run; the only time-varying
    edge (``odom->base_link``) is densely sampled, so a nearest lookup
    (``time_tolerance=None``) reproduces the pose at each query time.

    An optional edge override replaces one edge with a fed trajectory so tf
    reflects the poses being scored. It re-parents the child (drops every existing
    edge into that child) so the fed edge is the only route to it, matching a
    shortest-path lookup. The override is applied lazily on first lookup, so
    recordings whose scans are already world-framed never pay for it. Provide it
    at construction (``odom_tf`` + ``odom_stream``) or later via ``override_edge``.
